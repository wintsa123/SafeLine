In the next dialog box, enter the information to the original website.    

- **Domain**: domain name of your original website, or hostname, or ip address, for example: `www.chaitin.com`
- **Port**: port that SafeLine will listen, such as 80 or 443. (for `https` websites, please check the `SSL` option)

## Try to attack your website

Now, your website is protected by SafeLine, let’s try tp attack it and see what happens.

If https://chaitin.com is a website protected by SafeLine, here are some test cases for common attacks:

- SQL Injection: `https://chaitin.com/?id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1`
- XSS: `https://chaitin.com/?id=<img+src=x+onerror=alert()>`
- Path Traversal: `https://chaitin.com/?id=../../../../etc/passwd`
- Code Injection: `https://chaitin.com/?id=phpinfo();system('id')`
- XXE: `https://chaitin.com/?id=<?xml+version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE+foo+SYSTEM+"">`

Replace `chaitin.com` in the above cases with your website domain name and try to access it.
